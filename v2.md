# B-inject v2

_Open injection_

If you provide content from the blockchain you are compatible with the B-inject protocol v2 if you

- Are compatible with the B-inject protocol v1 or v1+

- Have a way for the client to indicate that the text `{{B://xyz}}` will be replaced with the raw unprocessed content of one specific other TX

- Have a way for the client to indicate that the text `{{B://xyz/}}` will be replaced with the B-inject treated content of the TX (nested injections)

Please note that v2 does not indicate how a content provider lets a client indicate what TX to target

See [b-inject.bico.media](//b-inject.bico.media) for more information.
