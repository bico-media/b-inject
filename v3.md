# B-inject v3

_Multiple open injections_

If you provide content from the blockchain you are compatible with the B-inject protocol v3 if you

- Are compatible with the B-inject protocol v2

- Have a way of letting the client indicate a sequence of open injections to replace (`{{B://xyz1}}{{B://xyz2}}{{B://xyz3}}` to be replaced with TX1, TX2 and TX3)

Please note that v3 does not indicate how a content provider lets a client indicate what TXs to target.

See [b-inject.bico.media](//b-inject.bico.media) for more information.
