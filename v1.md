# B://andlebars v1

High-level description:

> If you provide content from the blockchain you are compatible with the B://andlebars protocol v1 if

> - The text `{{B://[TX]}}` will be replaced with the raw/unprocessed content of TX
>
> - The text `{{B://[TX]/}}` will be replaced with the processed content of the TX (nested injections)

## Introduction

The B://andlebars protocol v1 describes the concept "direct injection". It is a structured way of replacing a specific part of the content in one transaction with the full content of a specific other transaction. 

### Context

- **Content**: When referencing `content` or `content of a transaction` it is referring to data stored in a blockchain transaction after an `OP_RETURN` code. 

- **Content provider**: any website (often http(s) based) letting clients access files made from data on the blockchain. 

- **TX**: A transaction ID on the BSV blockchain. Also known as TXID. Consists of 64 hexadecimal signs. They will be referred to as `TX` or `[TX]`.

- **Current TX**: The data of the transaction the client have asked for. 

- **Parent TX**: The data of the transaction referencing another transaction. 

- **Target TX**: The data of a transaction referenced to by content in another transaction. 



## Description

A "bandlebar" is a text string consisting of a 'moustache' like syntax of `{{...}}` directly surrounding a URL starting with `B://` followed by a 64 chars hexadecimal transaction ID. Bandlebars are case insensitive.

Bandelbars for v1 comes in 2 versions. One for raw data and one for processed data. 

### Raw data
Bandlebars for raw data are formatted like `{{B://[TX]}}` and indicates that the raw untreated data of the target TX must replace the bandlebar. The replacement must be binary safe and there can be no added content like space or lines. This means that any bandlebars in the target TX will remain unreplaced in the current content. 


### Processed data

Bandlebars for processed data are formatted like `{{B://[TX]/}}` and indicates that the content provider process the data of the target TX. The processing must include replacing aspects described in B://andlebars v1. The content provider is free to do any other processing of the content as long as its consistent with what the client will get when loading the TX directly. 


#### Hint

Bandlebars for processed data may have added a hint at the end of the url to indicate to the content provider what the processing must include.
In v1 there are two possible hint that can be given:
 
- `B64` formatted like `{{B://[TX]/B64}}` 
- `B64/` formatted like `{{B://[TX]/B64/}}`

##### Processing a `B64` hint
A `B64` hint shall be processed by the following sequence before injecting it into the content of the parent TX:

- If data is formatted like a dataURL all data up until and including first `,` must be discarded.
- Data is base 64 decoded

##### Processing a `B64/` hint
A `B64/` hint shall be processed by the following sequence before injecting it into the content of the current TX:

- Any bandlebars are processed as specified in v1
- If data is formatted like a dataURL all data up until and including first `,` must be discarded.
- Data is base 64 decoded
- Any bandlebars are processed as specified in v1


## Other aspects

### Errors

If any error happens during the processing this must be signalled to the client by replacing the `//` part of the url in the bandlebar with an emoji. If the tx provided is not found on the blockchain the emoji must always be "Cross Mark". Example:

	{{B:‚ùå66a6e1eb5ebecca707a03740069461a6b8fa9cca3753d00009f47d1d68a15d25}}

"Cross Mark" must be the default emoji but each content provider is free to select other emojis to indicate other problems as they see fit. Examples could be üî• for internal server errors, ‚åõ for timeouts and ‚ò†Ô∏è if a base64 decoding fails based on a `B64 ` hint.

Text that almost looks like a bandlebar (like if TX only has 63 chars or an unknown hint is given) must be left alone for the client to figure out why it was not processed. 


### Encoding

There shall be no encoding transformation during the flow of processing. This will result in all data being presented in the encoding of the current TX. 


## Implementation inputs

Any string that matches the following regular expression is a v1 bandlebar:

    /\{\{B:\/\/[a-f\d]{64}(\/(B64\/?)?)?\}\}/ig 


Examples:

- ‚úÖ `{{B://66a6e1eb5ebecca707a03740069461a6b8fa9cca3753d00009f49d1d68a15d25}}`

- ‚úÖ `{{b://66A6E1eb5ebeccA707A03740069461a6b8fa9cca3753d00009f49d1d68a15d25}}`

- ‚úñÔ∏è `{{B://66a6e1eb5ebecca707a03740069461a6b8fa9cca3753d00009f49d1d68a15d25 }}`

- ‚úñÔ∏è `{ {B://66a6e1eb5ebecca707a03740069461a6b8fa9cca3753d00009f49d1d68a15d25} }`

- ‚úÖ `{{B://66A6E1eb5ebeccA707A03740069461a6b8fa9cca3753d00009f49d1d68a15d25/}}`

- ‚úñÔ∏è `{{B://66a6e1eb5ebecca707a03740069461a6b8fa9cca3753d00009f49d1d68a15d25/ }}` 

- ‚úÖ `{{b://66A6E1eb5ebeccA707A03740069461a6b8fa9cca3753d00009f49d1d68a15d25/b64}}`

- ‚úñÔ∏è `{{B://66a6e1eb5ebecca707a03740069461a6b8fa9cca3753d00009f49d1d68a15d25/jpg}}` 


### Base 64 and data urls

Data urls becomes pure content if the following is replaced with an empty string:

    /^\s*data:[^,],/i
    
Please note that the original information about encoding is ignored v1 as only base64 is supported. 
    
### Loops 

As the content can only refer to previous transactions there will be no problem with circular references.
